# üé® Color Highlighting Feature - Grammarly-Style Error Detection

## Overview

This document describes the new **inline color highlighting** feature that has been added to Manuscript Editor Pro. This feature provides visual feedback directly in the editor, similar to Grammarly, making it easy to identify and fix grammar, style, punctuation, and spelling errors.

## ‚ú® Features

### 1. **Inline Color-Coded Highlighting**

Errors and suggestions are now highlighted directly in the Monaco editor with color-coded wavy underlines:

- **üî¥ Red Wavy Underline**: Grammar Errors (high severity)
- **üü† Orange Wavy Underline**: Grammar Warnings (moderate severity)
- **üîµ Blue Wavy Underline**: Style Issues
- **üü° Yellow Wavy Underline**: Punctuation Issues
- **üî¥ Red Dotted Underline**: Spelling Errors

### 2. **Hover Tooltips**

Hover over any underlined text to see:
- The error type (GRAMMAR, STYLE, PUNCTUATION, SPELLING)
- A description of the issue
- The suggested correction

### 3. **Enhanced Suggestions Panel**

The suggestions panel now includes:

#### **Color Legend** (Collapsible)
- Click the help icon (?) next to "Suggestions" to show/hide the color guide
- Visual reference showing what each color means
- Instructions on how to use the hover feature

#### **Improved Suggestion Display**
Each suggestion now clearly shows:

- **‚ùå Issue Box** (Red background): The problematic text
- **‚úÖ Correction Box** (Green background): The recommended fix
- **‚ÑπÔ∏è Info Message**: For suggestions without automatic corrections

#### **Prominent Action Buttons**
- **Green Checkmark Button**: Apply the correction to your document
- **Red X Button**: Dismiss/ignore the suggestion
- Buttons have hover effects for better visual feedback

### 4. **Minimap Integration**

Errors are also displayed in the Monaco editor's minimap (the small overview on the right side), making it easy to:
- See where errors are located in your entire document
- Navigate quickly to problem areas
- Get an overview of document quality at a glance

## üéØ How It Works

### Technical Implementation

#### EditorPanel Component (`src/components/EditorPanel.tsx`)

1. **Monaco Editor Integration**
   - Uses Monaco's decoration API to add inline highlights
   - Creates decorations based on suggestions from the context
   - Updates decorations automatically when suggestions change

2. **Color Styling**
   - Inline CSS styles define the appearance of each error type
   - Uses wavy underlines for most errors
   - Uses dotted underline for spelling errors

3. **Hover Messages**
   - Monaco's hover message feature displays correction suggestions
   - Formatted with markdown for better readability

#### SuggestionPanel Component (`src/components/SuggestionPanel.tsx`)

1. **Color Legend**
   - Collapsible section with visual color samples
   - Clear descriptions of what each color represents
   - User can toggle visibility with a button

2. **Enhanced Suggestion Cards**
   - Each suggestion displayed in a card format
   - Color-coded boxes for issue and correction
   - Border styling to distinguish error from fix
   - Monospace font for code-like display of text

3. **Action Buttons**
   - Larger, more prominent buttons
   - Color-coded backgrounds (green for accept, red for dismiss)
   - Hover effects for better UX

## üìñ User Guide

### Using the Color Highlighting

1. **Start Typing**
   - As you type, the editor automatically analyzes your text
   - Errors appear with colored underlines after 1 second of inactivity

2. **Review Highlighted Text**
   - Hover your mouse over any underlined text
   - A tooltip will appear showing the error and suggested correction

3. **View Color Legend**
   - Click the help icon (?) in the Suggestions panel header
   - The color guide will expand, explaining each color

4. **Apply Corrections**
   - Click the green ‚úì button next to a suggestion to apply it
   - The text in your document will be automatically updated
   - The suggestion will be removed from the list

5. **Dismiss Suggestions**
   - Click the red ‚úó button to ignore a suggestion
   - The suggestion will be removed but text remains unchanged

### Understanding Error Types

#### Grammar Errors (Red)
- Subject-verb agreement issues
- Incorrect verb forms
- Common mistakes (their/there/they're, its/it's, could of/could have)
- Serious errors that affect meaning

#### Grammar Warnings (Orange)
- Potential issues that may be intentional
- Less critical grammar concerns
- Context-dependent suggestions

#### Style Issues (Blue)
- Redundant words or phrases
- Wordy constructions
- Academic tone violations
- Passive voice overuse

#### Punctuation Issues (Yellow)
- Missing or extra spaces
- Incorrect comma usage
- Missing periods or other punctuation
- Quotation mark placement

#### Spelling Errors (Red Dots)
- Misspelled words
- Typos
- Unrecognized words

## üîß Configuration

The highlighting system automatically works with:

- **LanguageTool API**: Online grammar checking (requires internet)
- **Offline Checkers**: Citation validator, statistics validator, structure validator
- **Academic Rules**: PhD-level grammar and style rules

No configuration is needed - the system works out of the box!

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Don't Ignore Red Errors**: Grammar errors (red) are usually legitimate issues
2. **Consider Orange Warnings**: These may be style preferences - use your judgment
3. **Review Blue Suggestions**: Style issues can improve readability
4. **Check Yellow Marks**: Punctuation affects clarity
5. **Fix Red Dots First**: Spelling errors are usually the easiest to fix

## üöÄ Performance

- **Efficient Updates**: Decorations only update when suggestions change
- **Debounced Analysis**: Text is analyzed 1 second after typing stops
- **Minimal Overhead**: Highlighting adds negligible performance impact
- **Large Documents**: Tested with 50,000+ words

## üé® Accessibility

- **Color Blind Friendly**: Uses both color AND underline patterns
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All features accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Reader Support**: Suggestions are properly labeled
- **High Contrast**: Colors work in both light and dark modes

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Highlighting Not Showing

1. **Check Internet Connection**: LanguageTool API requires internet
2. **Wait for Analysis**: There's a 1-second delay after typing
3. **Monaco Loading**: Editor may take a few seconds to initialize

### Corrections Not Applying

1. **Click Green Button**: Make sure to click the ‚úì button
2. **Check Suggestion Has Fix**: Some suggestions are information only
3. **Try Dismissing**: If stuck, dismiss and manually fix

### Colors Look Different

1. **Dark Mode**: Colors are optimized for both themes
2. **Browser Settings**: Some browser extensions may affect colors
3. **Monitor Calibration**: Color perception varies by display

## üìù Examples

See `HIGHLIGHTING_FEATURE_DEMO.md` for visual examples and screenshots.

## ü§ù Contributing

To enhance the highlighting feature:

1. Modify `src/components/EditorPanel.tsx` for editor behavior
2. Modify `src/components/SuggestionPanel.tsx` for panel display
3. Add new error types in `src/types/index.ts`
